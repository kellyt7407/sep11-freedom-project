# Entry 1

The climate has been changing and it’s having a great impact on the ocean animals. Studying the ocean life can help you better understand the current situation sea animals are in. Recently, there was a climate strike that consist of young teens who cares about our earth and the animals that are endangered due to out actions. Based on reports from the UN, “Almost 33% of reef-forming corals are threatened with extinction…” In the past 30 years, 50% of coral reefs has gone extinct caused by our actions. Backed up with information from the IUCN’s Red List, “ 72 marine animal species are critically endangered, meaning they face an extremely high risk of extinction.” At this rate, our further generations might never be able to see what the ocean world is really like and it is our fault.

	I am currently in my third year in the Software Engineering Program( SEP), and I would like for everyone to acknowledge the fact that sea animals are becoming extinct in a rapid speed. If we don’t take action know and learn more about them before the ocean becomes lifeless. It is our responsibility to take action and do what is right to save our planet. No matter what age you are, it’s never too early to start saving our planet. 
	
	 I want to make a website, that educate others about the current issue that is developing as time goes on. We have to start by learning basic knowledge about our ocean before undertaking any inaccurate actions. According to The American Fisheries Society, “...700 species of freshwater or anadromous fish in North America as being imperiled, amounting to 39 percent of all such fish on the continent.” Most people are clueless and had no idea that such a great number of sea animals are dying. Everyone should participate and try to protect the oceans and those innocent living creatures that lives within it.
